# e621 Save Assistant

The __e621 Save Assistant__ is a tool designed to help you save images as efficiently as possible. Unlike an image grabber, this tool allows you to curate every image, making sure that everything you save is worthy of your collection.

Features include:
- The ability to save full images or samples to a folder of your choice, with automatically numbered file names.
- A customizable list of tag sets. The tool will automatically move onto the next tag set if the current set has run out of images.
- A customizable blacklist.
- The ability to create checkpoints for tag sets. When the tool reaches this tag set in the future, it will continue from this checkpoint.
- The ability to skip the remaining images in a search. These images will not show up in future searches, either.

The tool remembers where you left off when you close the application. No images will be repeated or skipped unless you say so. Furthermore, it remembers the newest image of each tag set that you looked at, making sure you are only served images that you haven't yet curated.
